# Documentation map

Documentation is organized by authority rather than investigation date.

When documents overlap, use this precedence:

1. reviewed `evidence/*.json` and named runtime manifests state accepted or
   falsified conclusions;
2. concise subsystem contracts state current ownership, behavior, and remaining
   uncertainty;
3. generated/static censuses state mechanically recovered coverage and facts;
4. deep reverse-engineering maps retain address-level detail but do not override
   a newer subsystem contract or evidence entry; and
5. Git history retains chronology and discarded implementations.

The source implements the current model, but a calibrated implementation is not
automatically a hardware fact. The relevant subsystem contract must label that
distinction.

## Address-level reverse-engineering references

The following are detailed firmware maps that remain useful when working in the
corresponding subsystem:

- `sim_registration.md`
- `sim_emulator_scope.md`
- `firmware_code_maps.md`
- `games_applications.md` (built-in games, their framework and boundary services)
- `games_applications_3310.md` (Space Impact on the 3310 v6.39: dispatch, state, levels, assets)
- `message_topology_census.md`
- `battery_classifier_analysis.md` (mapped battery ADC/classifier contract)

Absolute addresses apply to the 3210 v6.00 firmware unless explicitly stated
otherwise. These maps are retained because their coverage and exact addresses
make future work cheaper; their older interpretations are not authoritative.

Normalized reviewed evidence lives in `evidence/*.json`; named runtime inputs
live in `tools/run_manifests/*.json`. Run `make evidence-check` before banking a
new conclusion.

## Evidence policy

Keep:

- register maps and interface contracts;
- exact addresses needed to reproduce a conclusion;
- current acceptance conditions and hashes;
- unresolved questions with a concrete observation needed; and
- negative conclusions that prevent a plausible failed approach being repeated.

Remove or condense:

- chronological session narratives;
- repeated progress summaries;
- superseded plans and speculative component sketches;
- raw trace dumps already represented by a table or conclusion; and
- descriptions of probes or knobs that no longer exist.

Failed forcing implementations live in Git history. Only reusable negative
conclusions belong in `evidence/falsifications.json`; the current force policy
lives in `evidence_regime.md`.
