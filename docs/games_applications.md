# Built-in games: application map

The Nokia 3210 v6.00 Games menu offers Rotation, Snake and Memory. This
document maps the game applications, the framework they share, and the
phone-OS services they depend on. It is an address-level reverse-engineering
reference in the sense of `README.md`: absolute addresses apply to NSE-8/9
v6.00 only, names are project terminology, and reviewed conclusions that
affect the driver (the games NV records) live in the provisioning contract in
`eeprom_analysis.md` and `tools/make_eeprom_profile.py`.

The games are ordinary firmware. Nothing here proposes emulating them; the
map exists so that game behaviour can be traced, regression-tested and, for
external projects, re-hosted without guessing at the firmware's contracts.

## Plugin table and event interface

`game_table_2d9484` holds 12-byte records `{Thumb handler, pointer to a
3-byte record list, four bytes of per-game parameters}` indexed by
`game_index_11fd1b`:

| Index | Handler | Menu name |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `rotation_handler_241fd0` | Rotation |
| 1 | `snake_handler_240d82` | Snake |
| 2 | `memory_handler_24075c` | Memory |
| 3 | `game3_handler_242890` | not offered in the Games menu |

The fourth entry is React: the English text block's `React` string is
followed by instructions that describe exactly this game ("hit the pictures
by using keys 1-6", "six tries which you can repeat by pressing key 9",
"you lose points by hitting the cactuses"). It is a shooting gallery of six
windows whose pictures come and go on a 375 ms update; see
`game3_handler_242890` and its callees in the address map for the rules,
including the off-by-one in its scoring and the reseeding of `rand` from a
tick counter before every update. The `game3_` prefix is kept in the symbol
map until a renaming pass.

A fifth handler, `logic_handler_241780`, is not in the table at all. It is a
complete Mastermind-style game matching Nokia's "Logic" on the 5110/6110 and
the `Logic` string in the English text block, whose instructions describe
its keys (2, 4, 8, 5 and `*`) and marks; nothing on this product dispatches
to it. The settings block reserves five records, one per handler.

Tones: the games post tone ids through `display_type2_post_2b1f24(0, 0xf1,
id)`, which looks the id up in an 8-byte-record table at `0x2dc178` (the
literal at `0x2b200c`) whose records point at tone scripts in the 3310's
format (`games_applications_3310.md`): `0x10` (Snake eats, Memory pairs,
Logic checks, React hits) is note `0x9a` for one tick; `0x11` loops three
times over `0x7b` (440 Hz) for two ticks and a two-tick rest; `0x12`
(React shoots) loops eight times over `0x7b` for one tick and a five-tick
rest; `0x13` (Rotation solved) is `0x7e` for 15 ticks, a 3-tick rest and
`0x85` for 57. On this product note n sounds at 440 Hz x 2^((n - 0x7b)/12),
one below the 3310's scale, as the MAME buzzer traces of Snake's blip
(2637 Hz) and the game-over pulses (440 Hz) fix it.

Every handler receives one event code: `0x49` init, `0x53` resume, `0x54`
tick, `0x57` draw, and key events as ASCII (`0x31`..`0x39` digits, `0x23`
`#`, `0x2a` `*`). Snake steers with 2/4/6/8; Memory moves with 2/4/6/8 and
flips with 5; the fourth game maps keys 1..6 to its six cells.

The tick is self-scheduled: the handler re-posts delayed scheduler event
`0x30` through `sched_post_event_delay_2697aa`. Snake's delay is
`floor(10 * game_speed_table_2d9738[level] / 7.78125)` ticks with the table
`66 48 38 30 23 18 14 11 9` for levels 1..9.

## Timing

The speed table is in units of 10 ms and `7.78125` is the firmware's tick
length in milliseconds (255/32768 s): level 1 is meant to step every 660 ms
(84 ticks, 653.6 ms) and level 9 every 90 ms (11 ticks, 85.6 ms).

Measured in MAME with `mame_nokia_dct3_ram_probe.lua` tapping the snake
indices at `snake_state_110310`: 635 ms per step at level index 0 and 83 ms
at level index 8, i.e. 7.56 ms per tick (248/32768 s). The emulated
scheduler tick is therefore about 2.9 % shorter than the firmware's own
constant implies. This is recorded as an observation about the timer model,
not corrected here.

## Assets

All game graphics live in `0x2d9484..0x2d9a80` and are drawn through
`lcd_blit_bitmap_25f3b6` (column-major, bit `y & 7` per row) or plain
`lcd_fill_rect_25eec0` calls:

| Address | Content | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `0x2d9484` | `game_table_2d9484` | four 12-byte plugin records |
| `0x2d94bc` | `game_tile_bitmaps_2d94bc` | 7x7 tiles, 7 bytes each; blank + 0x49 symbols (Memory, Logic) |
| `0x2d96c4`, `0x2d96cc` | card back, cursor frame | 8 bytes each |
| `0x2d96ec` | `games_digit_glyphs_2d96ec` | 3x5 digits, 3 bytes each |
| `0x2d9738` | `game_speed_table_2d9738` | nine speed bytes |
| `0x2d9744` | `snake_food_bitmap_2d9744` | 4x4, 4 bytes |
| `0x2d9760` | `logic_params_2d9760` | rows (10), code length (5) |
| `0x2d9764` | `game3_backgrounds_2d9764` | 84x48 scenes, 504 bytes each |
| `0x2d995c` | `game3_sprites_2d995c` | 10x10 sprites, 20 bytes, outline/filled pairs |

Snake itself has no sprite for the body: segments are 3x3, 4x3 or 3x4 filled
rectangles on a 4-pixel cell pitch.

## Main menu Games icon

Runtime, from MAME frames with the main menu resting on Games (the icon
area matched against the dump). As on the 3310, the main menu's icons are
runs of 12-byte image records in `menu_images_2c9ef0`. The Games entry's
are records 103..115, `menu_games_icon_2c50d4`, thirteen 64x14 pictures
128 bytes apart. When the entry is shown, its first picture stays 1.08 s
(140 timer units), then the other twelve follow every 0.19 s (24 units)
and the first comes back and stays. Showing the entry again starts it
over; Phone book's four pictures (records 54..57) cycle the same way.
The code that steps the icons was not found.

## Settings records

NV descriptor `0x074c` maps EEPROM `0x0d9c` to five 4-byte records: big-endian
top score, level index 0..8, one byte the loader ignores.
`game_records_load_29a0e2` copies them into `game_records_11040c` (8 bytes per
game: `+0` current score, `+2` top score, `+4` level); `game_record_save_299e5e`
writes the current record back. An erased record indexes past the speed table
to speed 0, which made Snake advance every scheduler pass and left the Level
selector unable to move; the generated EEPROM profile now provisions level
index 0. See `eeprom_analysis.md`.

## Runtime evidence

- Per-phase function coverage (`mame_nokia_dct3_coverage.lua`, breakpoints on
  every candidate Thumb entry, re-enabled at phase boundaries) with a
  Memory-game control run on the identical key timeline isolates the Snake
  core at `0x240604..0x241620` and the game-over group at `0x262218`,
  `0x26225e`, `0x263468`.
- A raw PC trace window during play confirmed the tick path once the level
  record was provisioned; MAME plays all three menu games organically.
- `mame_nokia_dct3_force_game.lua` (external research hook) pins
  `game_index_11fd1b` to 3 before New game; the fourth handler runs to
  completion with its own scene bitmaps and a game-over screen.

## Address map

Names follow the repository convention (`role_address`). Rows marked as
hypotheses in `docs/data/games_function_notes.json` keep neutral prefixes
(`game3_`, field names) until the behaviour is proved.

| `0x2b31d8` | function | `periodic_slot_start_2b31d8` | Starts a periodic slot of kind arg0 with args (arg1 word, arg2 byte): takes the first free slot, copies the handler's u16 param, calls handler(1, slot) and posts delayed event 0x2c (5 ticks). Returns 0xff when all three slots are busy. menu_render_2629d0 uses the pair around the scrollbar/marquee st |
| `0x2b49b8` | function | `double_div_2b49b8` |  |
| `0x2b5068` | function | `double_mul_2b5068` | Software double multiply (sign = a.sign ^ b.sign, exponent add). menu_render_2629d0 computes the scrollbar thumb as (pos-1) * ((rows-7) op c) / (count-1) with this, double_div_2b49b8 and 0x2b44f6; Snake's tick delay uses the same family. |

| `0x2b5c7c` | function | `memcpy_2b5c7c` |  |
| `0x2b6018` | function | `atoi_2b6018` | atoi: skips leading space class, handles '+'/'-', accumulates decimal digits. |

| `0x2b63fc` | function | `int_to_double_2b63fc` |  |
| `0x2b64d4` | function | `rand_2b64d4` | ANSI C rand(): seed = seed*0x41c64e6d + 0x3039; returns (seed & 0x7fffffff) >> 16. Seed lives at 0x11250c. Used by snake_place_food_2416f6 and rotation_handler_241fd0. |
| `0x2b64e8` | function | `srand_2b64e8` | srand: stores arg0 into rand_seed_11250c (same literal as rand_2b64d4). game3_spawn_objects_242dd0 reseeds before spawning. |
| `0x2b65c8` | function | `strcat_2b65c8` | strcat: appends src to dst, returns dst. |

## Boundary services

`make games-callgraph` walks the BL closure from every candidate entry in the
games region (`0x240600..0x244000`) and the games framework
(`0x2621c0..0x263500`). Functions outside those ranges are boundary services:
the phone-OS contract the games rely on (scheduler delays, the RTOS block
allocator, the widget and menu layers, LCD drawing, string and float helpers,
`rand`). `make games-worklist WORKLIST_ARGS=--boundary` lists the ones still
unnamed.

## Unnamed residue

After the mapping pass the closure has 99 inner and 45 boundary functions;
the following stay unnamed on purpose. Each has a hypothesis block in
`docs/data/games_function_notes.json`.

| Address | Why it is not named |
|---|---|
| `0x262544`, `0x2624b8`, `0x262590` | Menu descriptor resolvers whose id remapping table (`0x11fc80`) and widget `0x1b`'s role are unproved. |
| `0x26344c` | Posts task-5 status `0x5de` after resetting cached UI tables; telephony-side failure path. |
| `0x24386a` | Leaf writing `0x110900`, whose reader is outside the closure. |
| `0x243964` | Vertical-extent helper inside the layout pass; needs a runtime probe of the neighbour fields. |
| `0x2ac6fc`, `0x2b4fd6`, `0x2ac70e` | Status-line indicator posting through widget class `0x67` and an 8-byte handler table; value semantics belong to the phone, not the games. |
| `0x2ae8ba`, `0x2ae7c4` | Phone status text builder and its cache reset. |
| `0x2b44f6` | Software double add/subtract; only the scrollbar uses it. |

None of these is reached by the three shipped games' handlers during play;
they are menu-framework and phone-side surfaces the games inherit.

## Naming cautions

- `game3_*` is React: the instructions string after `React` in the text
  block describes this game's keys, tries and cactuses. The prefix stays
  until the symbols are renamed in one pass.
- `logic_*` is inferred from mechanics plus the `Logic` string and the
  instructions next to it, which match the handler's keys and marks.
- Widget `+0x3f` is the style class and the top bits of `+0x41` the style
  variant, established through `widget_measure_22c15c`; the setters were
  renamed once that was proved.
- Addresses in `0x2431xx..0x2438xx` are the games' widget layer, not the
  general MMI window manager (task 6); do not conflate the two.
